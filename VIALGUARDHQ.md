# VialGuardHQ — Project Overview & Execution Plan

## Project Position in Portfolio
- App #1: OrderShifter (in progress, Shopify approval pending)
- App #2: GroomRoute (99% complete, launching ~Jan 15)
- **App #3: VialGuardHQ (next build target)**
- App #4: FixIQ (planned after VialGuardHQ)
- App #5+: CalmSweep, AutoPeace (later expansion)

VialGuardHQ is the correct next project because:
- High financial pain per customer
- High willingness to pay
- Low logo count needed for meaningful MRR
- Clear “breakage” narrative (loss, waste, compliance risk)
- Sales motion fits founder-led demos + outbound
- Can be built calmly while GroomRoute launches

## Product Summary (1 Sentence)
**VialGuardHQ helps medical spas and injectable clinics prevent inventory loss, compliance mistakes, and expensive errors by acting as a calm, always-on guardian for high-value injectables.**

---

## Target Customer (ICP)

### Primary ICP
- Medical spas
- Injectables clinics
- Aesthetic clinics offering:
  - Botox
  - Dysport
  - Fillers
  - Other high-cost injectables

### Buyer Persona
- Owner / medical director
- Practice manager
- Operations lead

### Characteristics
- Small teams
- High cost per unit
- Emotionally sensitive to:
  - waste
  - theft
  - miscounts
  - expired inventory
  - compliance exposure
- Already overwhelmed with:
  - spreadsheets
  - manual logs
  - paper systems
  - “we’ll remember” processes

---

## Core Problem (Breakage)

VialGuardHQ focuses on **invisible but expensive breakage**, including:

- Lost or missing vials
- Overuse / undocumented usage
- Expired inventory
- Poor lot tracking
- Manual double-entry
- Compliance anxiety
- “Who touched this last?” ambiguity
- End-of-month reconciliation stress
- Staff mistakes that cost hundreds or thousands

This is **money + anxiety**, not convenience.

---

## Product Philosophy

VialGuardHQ is:
- Calm
- Protective
- Non-judgmental
- Simple on the surface
- Deeply robust underneath

It is **not**:
- A full EMR
- A bloated inventory system
- A complex compliance dashboard

Think:
> “The thing that quietly makes sure nothing expensive goes missing.”

## MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

### 1. Inventory Guardian (Core)
- Track high-value injectables by:
  - Product
  - Lot number
  - Expiration date
- Simple intake logging
- Simple usage logging
- Automatic remaining balance calculation

### 2. Usage Logging (One-Tap)
- Log usage per patient session
- Capture:
  - amount used
  - product
  - provider
- Designed to be:
  - fast
  - non-intrusive
  - done at point-of-care or end of day

### 3. Discrepancy Detection
- Flag mismatches between:
  - expected vs actual remaining inventory
- Surface issues gently:
  - “This vial looks off by ~0.4 units”
- No blame, just visibility

### 4. Expiry Protection
- Automatic alerts for:
  - upcoming expirations
  - risky stock levels
- Calm messaging:
  - “This vial expires in 14 days”

### 5. Audit & History
- Immutable log of:
  - who logged what
  - when
  - adjustments
- Designed for:
  - internal peace of mind
  - external audits if needed

## Phase 2 / Expansion Features (Not Required for MVP)

- Staff accountability summaries
- Usage patterns by provider
- Cost leakage reports
- Monthly “money saved” summary
- Light integrations (accounting, EMR exports)
- Multi-location support

---

## Calm Center (VialGuardHQ Version)

The Calm Center here is **inventory-focused**, not scheduling.

### Example Calm Actions
- “Inventory feels off”
- “Something went missing”
- “Show me risk areas”
- “What expires soon?”
- “Reconcile today”

Each action:
- surfaces issues
- suggests next steps
- requires minimal judgment from user

Tone:
> Calm guardian, not auditor.

## Build Priority Order

1. Inventory data model
2. Intake / usage logging UX
3. Discrepancy detection logic
4. Expiry alerts
5. Calm Center UI (inventory-focused)
6. Reporting & audit views
7. Onboarding flow

---

## Success Definition (Early)

Within first 60 days:
- Clinics say:
  - “This makes me feel safer”
  - “I sleep better knowing this is tracked”
- At least 5 paying customers
- One clinic reports catching a real issue
- Demo → close rate >20%

---

## Internal North Star

If VialGuardHQ disappeared tomorrow, customers should say:
> “That would stress me out — we rely on it.”

That is product-market fit.
